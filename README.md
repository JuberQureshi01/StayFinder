üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is built on a modern, scalable, and feature-based architecture for both the frontend and backend, ensuring maintainability and ease of development.

Area

Technology

Frontend

React (with Vite), Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router, Mapbox GL

Backend

Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose)

Authentication

JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt.js

Image Storage

Cloudinary

Caching

Deployment

(e.g., Vercel for Frontend, Render for Backend)

Low-Level Design (LLD)
The backend is architected using strong LLD principles to ensure code is decoupled and scalable. Key design patterns used include:

Strategy Pattern: For handling different booking flows.

Observer Pattern: For notifying users of booking status changes.
